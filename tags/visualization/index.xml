      <description>Software systems are increasingly complex and extensive, making their understanding often difficult, costly and time-consuming. When we need to implement or change a feature in a system, it is often necessary to restructure it before changing it, doing refactoring, without modifying its external behaviors, improving not only its structure but also its comprehension and maintainability.
Sometimes it is difficult to know the state or quality of a software system, while it is being programmed since there are not many tools that allow the analysis of metrics in real-time.</description>
